# Matrix Tranposition

Tested to work on Linux systems.

## To compile

Either `cd` into the CPU (deliverable 1) or GPU (deliverable 2) directories.

Type `make`, it will compile all C files in the **src** directory, creating a **obj** directory in which all compiled object files will be placed, and it will then create a **transpose.out** executable.

## To run

Run the compiled program with `transpose.out <exponent>`, it will transpose a randomly generated square matrix of size 2^exponent.
